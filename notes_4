Python crash course lecture series 

we are going from the crash course of Python

we must have some basic Python experience before starting this course 

numbers 

strings 

print formatting

Python programming langugae 

Datatypes  

Lambda Expression:

	-def times2(var):return var*2
	
	-it removes extra words
	
	-its anonymous function
	
	-lambda var:var*
	
	-t=lambda var:var*  
	
	-t(6)

	-we will use lambda expression in list most commonly 
	
	-Example:
	
		-seq=[1,2,3,4,5]
	
		-list(map(lambda num:num*3,seq))	
		
	-we will use lambda function when using pandas library
	
	-lambda function is just a way of writing a simple function into a single line of clean code
	
	-if confused with lambda use simple function instead
	
Filter Function:

	-filter(lambda num: num%2==0,seq)
	
	-this will give some result in binary
	
	-to see a viable result, use th list function wrap around all this function instead
	
	-list(filter(lambda num:num%2==0,seq))
	
	-now this will give a result in more decent/readible manner
	
	-what this function is doing?
	
	-it will take values from the list and take their mod and return the values, the filter function is filtering those values who are satisfying the condition(means the even values)
	
Methods:

	-s='hello my name is Sam'
	
	-press s. and tab, u will get a list of methods
	
	-s.lower() will lower every single letter in a string 
	
	-s.upper() will upper case every single letter in a string
	
	-s.split() 
	
	-will split every single word on th base on space 
	
	-tweet='Go Sports! #Sports'
	
	-tweet.split()
	
	-.split() will split on the basis of given character
	
	-Forexample:
	
		-tweet.split('#')
		
		-Result will be: ['Go Sports!','Sports']
		
		-it has split the string on the basis of #tag
		
	-Lets create a dictionary 
		
	-d={'k1':1,'k2':2}
		
	-d to display the values
		
	-d.keys()
		
	-this will return the keys from the dictionary
		
	-d.items() will return the items of a dictionary
		
	-d.values() will return the values only of the keys only of a dictionary 
		
	-Also there are some useful methods for a list as well
		
	-lst=[1,2,3]
		
	-lst.pop() it will pop the last item of a list (it means it will display the items of a list and delete it from the list)
		
	-1st = [1,2,3,4,5]
		
	-item=lst.pop()
		
	-so the list will have now [1,2,3,4]
		
	-item will have 5 stored in it
		
	-first=lst.pop(0) this will pop off the index 0 item
		
	-first will have 1 stored in it
	
	-1st.append('new') it will append 'new' at the end of a list
		
	-'x' in [1,2,3]
	
	-it will check x in list, as x is not present there so it will return false
	
	-'x' in ['x','y','z'], now this will give true
	
Tuple Unpacking:

	-x=[(1,2),(3,4),(5,6)]
	
	-x[0] is the first tupple in a list that is (1,2)
	
	-x[0][0] will select the first tupple and then select the first element of that tupple that is 1
	
	-tuple unpacking is used in loops
	
		-for item in x:
			print(item)
			
		-it will print all the tuples
		
		-tuple unpacking will allow us to unpack all these tuples when going through the list
		
		-for (a,b) in x:
			print(a)
			
		-now it will print only 1,3,5 from the list
		
		-for (a,b) in x:
			print(b)
		
		-it will print the second item of every tuple from the list that is 2,4,6
		
		-this is tuple unpacking,instead of printing tuple we are unpacking every tuple
			
		-for (a,b) in x:
			print(a)
			print(b)

		-it will print 1,2,3 and then 4,5,6
